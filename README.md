I am developing this project as my first big Java application to strengthen my programming skills in preparation for a placement opportunity. The project involves managing data using a LinkedHashMap as a database structure, which I am implementing with a system for saving, locking, and reloading data efficiently. This challenge allows me to deepen my understanding of file handling, data persistence, and concurrency in Java while also improving my ability to design scalable and structured code. By committing to at least one hour of coding each day, I aim to build both my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities, making me better prepared for real-world software development.
